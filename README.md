# Kaggle Data Science Contest: Predicting Future Sales
This repo contains the code used for entering my first Kaggle Contest. An academic journal draft is also included in this repo.

## How the competition works
Contestants submit a .csv file onto Kaggle, and the system assesses the result based on the RMSE(Root mean squared error). The lower the RMSE, the better the code and used model, therefore, the higher the ranking.
